						%h4 Reporting incorrect events
						%p No one wants to go to a fake show or a fake venue. Data quality is very important to us, and we do our best to make sure every tour date and detail is correct. That said, if you see an event that you know 100%, no foolinâ€™, is absolutely fake or incorrect, you can email us with the details of the event, and a link to it. Use our email form here to send it in.
